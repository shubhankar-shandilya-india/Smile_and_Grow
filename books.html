              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Napolean hill</div>
              <p class="card-text mb-auto">1.	DESIRE-You would not have the desire that you have unless you were capable of achieving it. But it is your burning desire that is simply an accurate picture of what you will become. But your desire has to be a burning desire. You can’t be timid. And when you make the decision to attain your desire, you have to burn your bridges behind you and say this is it! I’ll never retreat! I’ll never go back!
                2.	FAITH-Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of the power of your thoughts and feelings. You can create the impossible through faith. But negative thoughts of anger, hatred or jealousy will destroy any benefit of having faith. When you believe in yourself and in your dreams, and when you establish a feeling of love for all people, you can accomplish anything.
                3.	AUTO SUGGESTION-This is the ability to focus your mind on your burning desire so much so that your subconscious mind accepts it as fact. At the heart of an auto suggestion is an affirmation – a statement of desire. An auto suggestion is a suggestion/affirmation by you, to yourself. This is tied to the 6 steps in the “Desire” principle where you would close your eyes and repeat those first 4 steps when you first get up, and just before bed.
                4.	SPECIALISED KNOWLEDGE-This principle is about how we must cultivate specialized knowledge of whatever it is that we decide to offer to the world in exchange for the money, success and abundance that we desire. In other words, you must become the expert in whatever you decide to specialize in.
                5.	IMAGINATION-“Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.” And this is regardless of how many times you have failed in the past. You have to develop the power of self motivation and the best way to do that is through imagination. You can go to the workshop in your mind where you get to create whatever it is that you want to create. The power of imagination is key to creating the life you want.
                6.	DECISION-All successful people make decisions very fast, but they change them very slowly. And all unsuccessful people make decisions very slow, and change them fast and often. The point is that you must get used to making big decisions quickly, but not give up too soon on an idea. We are too quick to dismiss a great idea, a dream and/or a lofty goal.
                7.	PERSISTENCE-Persistence is the one attribute that you must have in order to become successful. It is the main ingredient to a person’s character that separates the non-achievers from the achievers. So many of us give up right before success. But when you learn persistence and the concepts of decision, you can press forward to the reward of success. Persistence is the direct result of habit.
                8.	POWER OF THE MASTERMIND-A mastermind group is a group of at least two people who support one another in the common goal of attaining their goals, plans and dreams. It is a group of people who are sympathetic to your desire. The benefit of a mastermind group is that even if there is just one person besides yourself, they can help you to stimulate your mind for new thoughts. It’s almost as if a third mind can emerge

              <h3 class="mb-0">HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE</h3>
              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Dale carnegie</div>
              <p class="mb-auto">1. Do Not Criticize, Condemn or Complain 
                Carnegie writes, "Any fool can criticize, condemn or complain- and most fools do." He continues on to say that it takes character and self-control to be forgiving, this discipline will pay major dividends in your relationships with people.
                2. Be Generous With Praise 
                Carnegie uses Schwab as an example throughout the book, as someone who exemplifies all of the tenets Carnegie preaches. Schwab used praise as the foundation of all of his relationships, "In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in various parts of the world," Schwab declared, "I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted in their station who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than they would ever do under a spirit of criticism."
                3. Remember Their Name   
                Remembering people's names when you meet them is difficult. You casually meet a lot of people so it's challenging, but if you can train yourself to remember people's names, it makes them feel special and important. Carnegie writes, "Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language."
                4. Be Genuinely Interested In Other People  
                Remembering a person's name, asking them questions that encourage them to talk about themselves so you discover their interests and passions are what make people believe you like them, so they in turn like you. Carnegie writes, "You make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you." If you break it down, you should listen 75% and only speak 25% of the time.
                PROMOTED
                5. Know the Value of Charm  
                One thing people do not discuss much in the job search industry is that so much of getting an opportunity is not about talent, where you went to college or who you know, it is people liking you. A good resume may get you in the door, but charm, social skills and talent keep you there, and people will normally pick someone they enjoy being around over a candidate they don't enjoy being around as much but is more talented. Become someone people want to talk to, be genuinely interested in other people, because it will enrich your life and open so many more doors than you ever thought possible.
                6. Be Quick To Acknowledge Your Own Mistakes   
                Nothing will make people less defensive and more agreeable than you being humble and reasonable enough to admit your own mistakes. Having strong and stable personal and professional relationships relies on you taking responsibility for your actions, especially your mistakes. Nothing will help end tension or a disagreement more than a swift acknowledgment and apology on your part.
                7. Don't Attempt To "Win" An Argument  
                The best way to win any argument, Carnegie writes, is to avoid it. Even if you completely dismantle someone's argument with objective facts, you won't be any closer to reaching an agreement than if you made personal arguments. Carnegie cited an old saying: "A man convinced against his will/Is of the same opinion still."

              <h3 class="mb-0">THE ALCHEMIST</h3>
              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Paulo coelho</div>
              <p class="card-text mb-auto">1. Fear is a bigger obstacle than the obstacle itself
                “Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encountered with God and with eternity.”
                Any new pursuit requires entering uncharted territory — that’s scary. But with any great risk comes great reward. The experiences you gain in pursuing your dream will make it all worthwhile.
                2. What is “true” will always endure
                “If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.”
                Truth cannot be veiled by smoke and mirrors — it will always stand firm. When you’re searching for the “right” decision, it will be the one that withstands the tests of time and the weight of scrutiny. 
                3. Break the monotony 
                “When each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.”
                Gratitude is the practice of finding the good in each day. Life can easily become stagnant, mundane, and monotonous, but that changes depending on what we choose to see. There’s always a silver lining, if you look for it.
                4. Embrace the present
                “Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man.”
                There’s no point dwelling in the past and letting it define you, nor getting lost and anxious about the future. But in the present moment, you’re in the field of possibility — how you engage with the present moment will direct your life.

                5. Your success has a ripple-effect
                “That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.”
                Growth, change, and evolution are weaved into the fabric of reality. Becoming a better version of yourself creates a ripple effect that benefits everything around you: your lifestyle, your family, your friends, and your community. 
                6. Make the decision
                “When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he has never dreamed of when he first made the decision.”
                It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the unknowns and finer details of your dreams. Actions will flow out of having confidence in your decision; sitting on the fence will get you nowhere.
                7. Be unrealistic
                “I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.”
                Some of the greatest inventions would not have happened if people chose to accept the world as it is. Great achievements and innovations begin with a mindset that ignores the impossible.
                8. Keep getting back up
                “The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.”
                Because the eighth time could be your breakthrough. Some of the greatest novels in history were published after receiving hundreds of rejections. Thankfully, those authors never gave up. 
                9. Focus on your own journey
                “If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.”
                It’s easy to be influenced by others, but you’ll be miserable if you end up living someone else’s life. There’s nothing wrong with taking advice and learning from others, but make sure it aligns with your desires and passions.

              <h3 class="mb-0">THE MONK WHO SOLD HIS FERRARI</h3>
              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Robin sharma</div>
              <p class="mb-auto">1. Trade money in for meaning
                The online world is highlighting right now the shift that is happening. People are starting to look at their time more closely and making changes to their income based on doing something that has more meaning. Companies that have a meaning or a social cause to them are beating the traditional corporations. The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is all about two lawyers who some would say have it all, and how one of the lawyers traded in all he had to become fulfilled, happy and healthy again.
                To create his own meaning, Julian Mantle from the book travels to the Himalayas to become enlightened through a group of monks. He then comes back to the western world and shares all of his wisdom with his former colleague John.
                This act is the true definition of giving meaning to your life and shows the power of meaning versus money. Are you going to start to add more meaning to your own life?
                2. Empty your cup so you can fill it with new ideas
                Think about all the people you work with. Are they open to new ideas and do they want to try something new? The answer is probably no, and the reason for this is that their hypothetical cup is constantly full. The only way to be able to open your mind, take on new thoughts, and change your current position in life is to empty your cup (your mind).
                The book teaches us that we can only change when we make space for change in our lives. This means that you have to be prepared to potentially re-learn everything you have been told and question everything that someone tells you from now on.
                Failure to empty your cup will cause you to stand still and not grow. When the mind doesn’t grow it starts to take on more and more negative thoughts and create predictable outcomes.
                3. You must open your own heart before you can touch other people’s hearts
                Julian Mantle in the book teaches us that we can only help others, love others and inspire others if we work on ourselves first. When we reach a place where we feel centered and alive, we are able to find inspiration within.
                As we work on ourselves our natural progression is to help others, and we do so often without consciously knowing – it’s what we were designed as humans to do.
                4. Understand how powerful simplicity can be
                As the book goes a bit deeper, a simple fable is revealed to the character of John. Initially, he thinks that the fable is too in complex and dismisses it entirely. As he becomes more enlightened, he realizes that the power is in simplicity.
                Look at our world; the best marketing is simple, the best advice is simple, the best phone is simple – simple is the best form of anything. It’s easy for us to want to over complicate things to make ourselves feel smart, but what this book teaches us is that complexity is the enemy we should be trying to avoid.
                Complexity is what puts us in an education system that gives us zero emotional intelligence and doesn’t help us to understand the operating manuals of our minds. Complexity is what makes us forget that vitality and energy come from what we put in our mouths and that simplistic eating from natural sources is the best kind.
                5. Worry will drain your mind of its power
                Modern day life contains so much worry. Our minds are exhausted by all the things we are told we must have to be happy and all the things we are told we must do by a certain deadline. What if we decided that happiness was more important than worry? What if we trained our brains to be happy with where we are right now and not to worry about what anyone else thinks?

              <h3 class="mb-0">THE POWER OF MY SUBCONCIOUS MIND</h3>
              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Joseph Murphy</div>
              <p class="card-text mb-auto">1.	It is a servant - it follows orders. Your conscious mind is the gate-keeper to monitor those orders. The subconscious does not distinguish between physical reality and what you are thinking - it’s all real to it. It has no sense of humor and takes everything literally.
                2.	It responds with instinct and habit. As patterns are deepened they become habits that become harder to change.
                3.	It is programmed by repetition, authority and emotion. Affirm and visualize often. Be strong and willful and command the subconscious mind using your passion and emotional power.
                4.	It does not process negatives. If you say "I will not gain weight," the subconscious mind only hears "I will gain weight." State all affirmations in positive terms.
                5.	It represses memories with unresolved negative emotions yet these unacknowledged, stored memories affect your experience now. Any time you feel strong guilt, resentment, fears, anger and depression, this is an opportunity to own and release them.
                6.	It works with symbols and metaphors. Watch your dreams closely for meaningful symbols.
                7.	It takes everything personally. It keeps a photocopy of everything. As you resent, judge and project onto others, you are doing it to yourself.
                8.	It works on the principle of least effort. It follows the path of least resistance. Engrained habits are often a path of least resistance.
                9.	It has a need to be moral. The subconscious mind connects to (and also filters and discolors) your higher self or whatever you want to call it and supports your evolution towards love, beauty and truth.
                10.	It knows only now. There is no future or past in the subconscious mind. All stored experiences are processed as NOW. So affirm in the now, not in the future. Know that the past affects you NOW, offering an opening for healing NOW.

              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Vyasa </div>
              <p class="mb-auto">1
                Change is the law of nature- Lord Krishna taught Arjun that nothing stays forever. ‘Change’ is the only constant. People, surroundings, their behavior everything will change as the time will pass. Nothing is permanent in our lives. We should learn to accept and welcome changes. This may help us face tough situations and tackle them bravely.
                Therefore, being proud of your wealth and materialistic possessions is a symbol of immaturity as it can vanish within a blink of an eye.
                2
                You have come empty-handed and will leave empty-handed- Nothing in this universe particularly belongs to any individual. Everything in this universe belongs to the creator, Almighty himself.
                As Lord Krishna said, “You came empty handed and will leave empty-handed. What is yours today belonged to another person yesterday and will belong to another person tomorrow.” We won’t carry these possessions to our grave. Thus, getting attached to them is of no significance.
                3
                Everything happens for a reason- Everything happens for our own good. Be it good times or bad, there is a reason for every situation we face. It is a cycle and we should accept it calmly.
                This lesson asks people not to regret the past or worry about the future. We need to be optimistic and have faith in the supreme power. God has already planned everything for our good.
                You just need to enjoy the present to its fullest and make it worth living.

                The soul is immortal, it is neither born nor does it die- The fear of death is nonsensical as a soul never dies. Don’t worry if you are getting old as everyone has to die one day. The body is mortal but the soul is immortal. A fearless soul has nothing to worry about. It works for the satisfaction and progress of the inner soul.
                We can achieve inner peace, our ambitions, and dreams if we eradicate the fear of death from our minds.

              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by APJ Abdul Kalam</div>
              <p class="card-text mb-auto">1.YOU MUST HAVE DREAMS
                Dr Kalam always believed that in order to see your dreams come true, you first need to have a dream to pursue. He claimed that a dream however impossible brought one close to making it possible, but it was essentially required for one to possess the dream
                
                2. THE THREE KEYS TO A CORRUPTION-FREE COUNTRY MUST PLAY THEIR PART
                Showing his faith in three key societal members, Dr Kalam firmly believed that the father, the mother and the teacher have a humungous role to play in making a difference to the nation. He taught us that a country can only become a nation of beautiful minds if these members play their part correctly.
                3. HAVE COURAGE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY
                Dr Kalam was and will be an inspiration for the youth. He motivated us all to build courage—the courage to think differently, to invent, to travel the unexplored path, to discover the impossible and most importantly, to overcome problems
                4. DEVOTION IS NECESSARY
                Dr Kalam always wanted people of his nation to succeed in their mission. And, his mantra for success was single-minded devotion to the goal. He stressed that to be devoted, is to bear fruits of success
                5.A LEADER MUST BE VISIONARY AND PASSIONATE
                Dr Kalam gave an incredible definition of a leader. He said that a leader must have vision and passion and he must not be afraid of obstacles that will inevitably cross his path. A successful leader is one who knows how to overcome his problems
                6. DIFFICULTIES HELP YOU ENJOY SUCCESS
                Dr Kalam's suggestion to someone who has continually failed in his efforts is to never give up. It is through difficulties and failure that one truly enjoys the fruits of his labor. He advised people of the nation to beat their difficulties raw
                7. THE WHOLE UNIVERSE WORKS TO GIVE YOU THE BEST
                Dr Kalam always went out of his way to fill the lives of hard workers and dreams a life of positivity. He assured us that the road to success isn’t a lonely one. In fact, the whole universe is with us and it brings the best to people who chase their dreams
                8. GREAT DREAMS WILL ALWAYS FIND A WAY
                A great dreamer himself, Dr Kalam believed that great dreams of great dreamers are always transcended
                9.A BETTER TOMORROWS COMES FROM TODAY
                Dr Kalam propagated building of a better tomorrow. He has time and again asked the people of his nation to sacrifice their today so that our children can have a better tomorrow.
                10.GOD HELPS THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES
                Dr Kalam was very clear on this principle. He believed that god only helps those who work hard and head strong towards their goal, and not someone who broods over his life doing nothing

              <h3 class="mb-0">RICH DAD POOR DAD</h3>
              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Robert T. Kiyosaki</div>
              <p class="mb-auto">1 The Rich Don’t Work for Money
                The rich dad says “Money works for me” – not the other way around. He wants you to work to let you learn how money works and how to have it work for you. But if you want to master how, first, you have to alleviate your fear.
                According to the rich dad, fear is the primary emotion when the subject of money is discussed. It keeps most people to stay in their job because they fear of not being able to pay the bills or not having enough money. Greed is the second; if you offer more money, they also increase spending. If you don’t want to become slave to your money, you have to think about it logically, not through emotions.
                2 Why Teach Financial Literacy?
                The rich dad believes that money without financial intelligence is money soon gone. This is why he stresses the importance of financial education. Schools only teach people how to work for money. They are designed to produce good employees instead of employers. What’s lacking in formal education is the so-called financial aptitude – what you do with the money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from you, how long you keep it, and how hard that money works for you. If you want to become financially independent, you have to know and understand your numbers.
                3 Mind your own Business
                Your profession and your business are different from each other. You should not rely on your job to become financially secure; instead, focus on your own business and develop your assets. As Kiyosaki puts it, “financial struggle is often directly the result of people working all their life for someone else. Many people will have nothing at the end of their working days.” Acquire assets and use them to purchase income-generating, real assets. The rich dad further noted that real assets are anything with value – stocks, bonds, mutual funds, income-producing real estate, notes, royalties from intellectual property, etc.
                4 The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations
                The idea of taxes started when people were made believe that it was intended to punish the rich. In reality, the poor and middle class, the very people who accepted and voted for it, were the ones disadvantaged. “Once government got a taste of money, the appetite grew,” said the rich dad. In the government, the larger his organization, the more he is respected. On the other hand, within my organization, the fewer people I hire and the less money I spend, the more I am respected by my investors.
                The point is, the rich people are aware of how much they are being manipulated by this system, but they don’t let these hinder them. Having a good knowledge in four broad areas of expertise – accounting, investing, understanding markets, and law – make them understand how to protect and enhance their assets.

              <h3 class="mb-0">THE FOUR AGREEMENTS</h3>
              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Miguel Ruiz</div>
              <p class="card-text mb-auto">1. If you live without fear, if you love, it is logical that you will feel good. When you feel good, it is logical that everything around you is good.  When everything around you is great, everything makes you happy.  You are loving everything that is around you, because you are loving yourself.  Because you like the way you are.  Because you are content with you.  Because you are happy with your life.  You are happy with the movie that you are producing, happy with your agreements with life.  You are at peace, you are happy. (pg 53)
                2. You are not here to sacrifice your joy or your life. You are here to live, to be happy and to love.  If you can do your best in two hours of meditation, but you spend eight hours instead, you will only grow tired, miss the point, and you won’t enjoy your life.  Do your best and perhaps you will learn that no matter how long you meditate, you can live, love and be happy.  (pg 78)
                3. Awareness is always the first step because if you are not aware, there is nothing you can change. (pg 99)
                4. The next step is to develop awareness of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy. You take an inventory of all that you believe and through this process you begin the transformation. The Toltec’s called this the Art of Transformation, and it’s a whole mastery. You achieve the Mastery of Transformation by changing the fear-based agreements that make you suffer, and reprogramming your own mind, in your own way. (pg 107)
                5. The human mind is like a fertile ground where seeds are continually being planted. The seeds are opinions, ideas, and concepts. You plant a seed, a thought, and it grows.  The word is like a seed and the human mind is so fertile! What is important is to see which kinds of seeds our mind is fertile for, and to prepare it to receive the seeds of love. (pg 28)
                6. Imagine you have permission to be happy and to really enjoy your life. Your life is free of conflict with yourself and with others. (pg 125)
                7. We must forgive those we feel have wronged us, not because they deserve to be forgiven, but because we love ourselves so much we don’t want to keep paying for the injustice. (pg 114)
                8. Imagine living your life without fear of expressing your dreams. You know what you want, what you don’t want, and when you want it. You are free to change your life the way you really want to. You are not afraid to ask for what you need, you say yes or no to anything or anyone. (p. 125)
                9. Imagine living your life without the fear of being judged by others. You no longer rule your behavior according to what other may think about you. (p. 125)
                10. Imagine living your life without judging others. You can easily forgive others and let go of any judgments that you have. You don’t have the need to be right, and you don’t need to make anyone else wrong. You respect yourself and everyone else, and they respect you in return. (p. 125)
                11. Imagine living without the fear of loving and not being loved. You are no longer afraid to be rejected, and you don’t have the need to be accepted. You can walk in the world with your heart completely open, and not be afraid to be hurt. (p. 125)
                12. Our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive – the risk to be alive and express what we really are. Just being our self is the big
                Gets fear of humans. We have learned to live our life trying to satisfy other people’s demands. We have learned to live by other people’s points of view because of the fear of not being accepted and of not being good enough for someone else. (p. 17)
                13. The freedom we are looking for is the freedom to be ourselves, to express ourselves. But if we look at our lives we will see that most of the time we do things just to please other, just to be accepted by others, rather than living our lives to please ourselves. (p. 98)
                14. When you transform your whole dream, magic just happens in your life. This is the mastery of intent, the mastery of love, the mastery of gratitude, and the mastery of life. This is the path to personal freedom. (pg 74)
                15. that is why it is important for you to master your own dream…Your life is the manifestation of your dream; it is an art. And you can change your life anytime if you aren’t enjoying the dream. Dream masters create a masterpiece of life; they control the dream by making choices.

              <h3 class="mb-0">7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE</h3>
              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">by Stephen Covey</div>
              <p class="mb-auto">1. Master the ‘four quadrants of time-management’
                The first life-changing lesson is one of the most important you could ever learn about maxing out the value of your time. It’s called the “Eisenhower method” and it’s named after former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was reportedly the first to use it.
                In his book, Covey calls it the “four quadrants of time-management” and expands upon the idea further.
                The four quadrants are as follows:
                •	Quadrant 1: Important, Urgent
                •	Quadrant 2: Important, Not Urgent
                •	Quadrant 3: Not Important, Urgent
                •	Quadrant 4: Not Important, Not urgent
                The basic idea behind the four quadrants is this that there are two primary factors which are constantly fighting against one another when it comes to our actions: urgency and importance.
                By organizing our tasks based on all four possible combinations of these two principles, you can identify where you should be placing most of your time (hint: it’s Quadrant 2) and which should be pushed back for those priority tasks.
                2. Create it in your mind before attempting to make it a reality
                Every great achievement in recorded history took forethought and planning to achieve. So, before you can ever hope to make something a reality– or, at the very least, as you go– you must first create a clear and thorough plan for doing just that.
                More than just creating a plan for achieving X goal, this is about reverse engineering your success.
                It’s about looking forward into the future and imagining yourself accomplishing said goal and then working backward to imagine how, piece by piece, you might make that goal a reality in concrete, measurable terms.
                Covey says we need to, “begin with the end in mind” and use our imagination to craft a vision that is not just compelling, but practical.
                3. Find your circle of influence and focus in
                This is one of the greatest productivity lessons of all: the “Circle of Concern.”
                Throughout our life, we have many different things which we care about and that concern us. This includes family, health, our job, long-term career goals, politics, the threat of war, and so on. This is our circle of concern.
                However, within this circle of concerns there are many things which we can’t do much about, or, at least, as much as other things. By focusing in on those things within our circle of concern which we can exert the most influence over, we can maximize our influence and productivity. This is our circle of influence.
                It’s your job to find your own circle of influence, whether that’s within your work, business, or life at large so you can find the things which will be the most productive use of your time.
                4. Focus on fundamental principles
                In 7 Habits, Covey talks about the relatively recent shift (last century) from a principle-centered method of self-improvement to one which is now focused on acquiring things such as skills and abilities.
                Since even before the ancient Greeks, principles-centered living was known to cultivate character, and that cultivation of character led to happiness and achievement. This way of living creates a sort of harmony between us and the world that allows us to move about the world more effectively.
                I personally love this approach because it develops virtues in you which make you a stronger, wiser, and more effective human being as a whole, not one specialized in one or two subjects who then have problems in areas in which they don’t have sufficient skill or experience.
                5. The 4 generations of time-management
                The final lesson is one of my favorite of all and it’s an incredibly smart insight into the way our mind works and how we can maximize our productivity.
                Covey refers to it as the ‘four generations of time management’ and he describes them as so:
                •	1st Generation: The “to-do” list. An “effort to give some semblance of recognition and inclusiveness to the many demands placed on our time and energy.”
                •	2nd Generation: Future planning such as personal calendars. No longer simply dealing with the wave of demands, we now seek to take control.
                •	3rd Generation: Adds prioritization + goal setting. Certain things are more important than others, so we must compare the value of each activity and structure our time in a way that matches these priorities.
                •	4th Generation: Shift in perspective from time and “things” to cultivating relationships and results.</p>
